first compile and build the server using make webserver.
Testing of our server can be ran and compiled in server_test.cc
Our config file is called config, so when running the webserver
run it as ./webserver config
We then have defined three subclasses, not_found_handler found in
Not_Found_Handler.cc, echoHandler found in echoHandler.cc, and
StaticHandler found in StaticHandler.cc. These subclasses deal
with the individual handlers, based on what is in the URI data,
we will chose which handler to use.

Our main function is ran in request.cc, and does the following
it first parses the config and then calls the get_port method
then it calls config_to_handlers which takes in a config_file
and returns a vector of maps, that contain keys indicating
"handler", "path", and also potentially "directory" with 
appropriate values stored. The making of these maps is done
in getChildBlock. Our main function then calls the server
with the io, our port, and our vector of handlers (which are maps)

Our server function makes socckets, and then runs the session on a thread and the session takes the socket and the handlervector

Our session function initializes an http request req, a uri_path, 
echo and static handlers and response rep. We also initialize a 
request_parsere rparser. Than we wait for data to process in a forloop
Then it listens and parses that data into an httpRequest using our 
rparser and calling its parse method that we initialized. We 
then also store the raw_req that was just the input data into
a request string.

then we iterate through all of the handlers to see if
the path is contained in our uri, and if it is we erase the 
portion from the uri that is the path 
ex:
uri = /echo/FooBar
newURI = /FooBar
and then we remove the handler field from the map. Finally we either
handle the request using the handler fieldSpecified to determine which
handler subclass to use. After we have determinded which subclass to 
use we pass the reply and request that we initialized. the reply
is blank.
